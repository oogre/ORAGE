## Introduction
__ORAGE is a live visual modular synthetizer__</br></br>
As visual artist and developper, I think a part of my creativity comes from my shortcomings. Therefore, build my own visual softwares has always been obvious.
This tool is in fact the «whathousand» iteration of that idea to create that kind of software.

Take a look at [ORAGE TV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ0oXcxj3lE8kQSSsniIZ6w) to see it in action.
## Inspiration
I'm inspired by analogic video synth as [LZX](https://lzxindustries.net/),<br/>
node programming visual generators as [cables.gl](https://cables.gl/home),<br/>digital video synth as [Lumen](https://lumen-app.com/),<br/>
glitch production softwares as [signal culture](http://signalculture.org/),<br/> 
this amazing tutorial [the book of shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com)<br/> and many others... <br/> Last but not least, I've been mainly inspired by my bandmate [Harold Osica](https://www.facebook.com/osicamusic).
