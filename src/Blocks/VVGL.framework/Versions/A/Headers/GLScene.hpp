/*!
\ingroup VVGL_BASIC
A GLScene is a container for a GL context that lets you provide various callbacks which are executed at specific times during rendering.  The interface is geared towards making it easy to load frag/vert/geo shaders, perform orthographic projection, providing customized drawing code, subclassing, and rendering to textures/buffers/GLBuffers.  Used as a subclass of several other classes, also used in sample apps to perform GL rendering and output.
